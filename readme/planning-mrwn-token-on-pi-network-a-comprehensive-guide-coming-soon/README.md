# ü™ô MRWN Token on Pi Network: A Comprehensive Guide (Coming Soon)

Welcome to the official documentation for the **MRWN Token** and its integration with the **Pi Network** blockchain! This guide provides all the essential information you need to understand how MRWN works, where to see it on the blockchain, and how Pi Network users can interact with it.

***

### üìñ What is the MRWN Token?

The **MRWN Token** is a **utility token** created by the **Mrwain Organization** to power its decentralized ecosystem. It is built on the **Pi Network blockchain**, utilizing Pi‚Äôs decentralized technology to create a secure, transparent, and community-driven platform. The MRWN Token is used across various Pi-based **decentralized applications (DApps)** such as **TruthWeb**, **Cloudy**, **TaskHub**, **Salenus**, and more.

Unlike **Pi tokens** (PI), which are the native currency of the Pi Network, **MRWN** is a separate token created specifically to be used within the **Mrwain Organization** ecosystem.

***

### ü™ô MRWN Token on Pi Network Blockchain

#### 1. **Where to See MRWN Token on the Blockchain**

Once the **MRWN token** is deployed on the **Pi Network mainnet**, it will be visible on the **Pi Blockchain Explorer** and interactable through the **Pi Wallet**. Here's where you can track and manage MRWN:

#### üåê **Pi Blockchain Explorer**

The **Pi Blockchain Explorer** will allow users to:

* **View MRWN token transactions**
* Check **MRWN token balances** for different addresses
* Inspect the **MRWN token‚Äôs smart contract** details
* Track the **status of MRWN token transfers**

Once deployed on the Pi Network mainnet, every MRWN token transaction will be recorded publicly, ensuring transparency and traceability.

#### üíº **Pi Wallet**

The **Pi Wallet** will support **MRWN token storage and transactions**, similar to how it currently handles **Pi tokens**. Pioneers will be able to:

* **View their MRWN balance** alongside their Pi token balance
* **Send and receive MRWN** as payments or rewards within Pi-based DApps
* **Store MRWN tokens** securely in their Pi Wallet

***

### üîí Security and Transparency

The **MRWN smart contract** is **open-source** and **deployed on the Pi Network blockchain**, ensuring that all interactions are transparent and secure. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain and can be publicly verified using the Pi Blockchain Explorer.

***

### üèóÔ∏è MRWN Token Use Cases in Pi Network Ecosystem

The **MRWN token** powers the **Mrwain Organization** ecosystem, where users can **earn**, **spend**, and **hold** MRWN tokens. Here are some key use cases for MRWN across various DApps:

| **DApp**          | **MRWN Token Use**                                                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üåê **TruthWeb**   | MRWN tokens can be used for **buying, selling, tipping** creators     |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloudy**     | Pay for **storage**, **upgrades**, or premium features                |
| üõ†Ô∏è **TaskHub**   | **Earn MRWN** by completing tasks within the ecosystem                |
| üõí **Salenus**    | **Buy and sell** products using MRWN tokens                           |
| üìà **TrendForge** | **Access premium trend analysis** or subscribe to services using MRWN |

***

### üåç How MRWN and Pi Tokens Work Together

* The **Pi token (PI)** is the **native currency** of the Pi Network, primarily used for mining, staking, and as a store of value.
* The **MRWN token** is a **separate, utility token** that enhances the Mrwain ecosystem, facilitating transactions, rewards, and payments across various DApps.

While both tokens exist in the Pi ecosystem, **MRWN tokens** will **not directly affect the value or supply of Pi tokens**. However, **Pi Network users** can earn MRWN through participation in DApps and use it for services or transactions within the Mrwain ecosystem.

***

### üöÄ How to Interact with MRWN Tokens

Once MRWN tokens are live on the Pi Network mainnet, users can interact with them in the following ways:

#### 1. **Earn MRWN Tokens**

* Participate in Pi Network DApps (such as **TaskHub**, **TruthWeb**, etc.) and earn MRWN tokens as rewards for contributions or tasks completed.

#### 2. **Spend MRWN Tokens**

* Use MRWN tokens to pay for services, products, and features in the **Mrwain Organization** DApps. For example, users can spend MRWN to unlock premium content or services in **Cloudy** or **TruthWeb**.

#### 3. **Hold MRWN Tokens**

* Users can hold their MRWN tokens as an investment or store of value, particularly as the **Pi ecosystem grows** and the demand for MRWN tokens increases within the DApp ecosystem.

***

### üîß Technical Overview of MRWN Smart Contract

The MRWN token is an **ERC-20 style token**, which means it follows the same principles as Ethereum-based tokens but is deployed on the **Pi Network blockchain**. Here are the technical components:

* **Smart Contract**: Written in **Solidity**, a language used for Ethereum smart contracts.
* **Functionality**: Includes standard ERC-20 functions like **transfer**, **balanceOf**, and **approve** to enable token transfers and interaction within the Pi Network ecosystem.
* **Security**: The contract is **audited** and **open-source**, ensuring it operates as expected without vulnerabilities.

***

### üöÄ Roadmap for MRWN Token Deployment

* **Phase 1**: MRWN token creation, testing, and development on Pi Testnet
* **Phase 2**: Submission of the MRWN token for **Pi Network mainnet approval**
* **Phase 3**: Official launch on the **Pi Network mainnet** after KYC verification and Pi Network's open mainnet release
* **Phase 4**: Full integration with Pi-based DApps and Pi Wallet support

| Feature                  | Pi Network Support        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Solidity Smart Contracts | ‚úÖ Yes                     |
| ERC20 / Custom Tokens    | ‚úÖ Yes                     |
